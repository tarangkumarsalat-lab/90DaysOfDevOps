Day 01 – Introduction to DevOps and Cloud

- Task 1
- Today’s goal is to set the foundation for your DevOps journey.

- My 90-days personal DevOps learning plan
- weekly 6days learning - 1 day revision
- 2 hours weekdays
- 4 to 6 hours weekends
- 3 post on linkedin
  
- what is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

ANS:- devops is culture + set of practices that bring development and operations together.its focus on Collaboration,Automation,Fast, reliable delivery.
- its usually involves:-
  CI/CD pipelines – automated build, test, and deploy (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
  Infrastructure as Code – provisioning infra with code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
  Monitoring & observability – knowing what’s broken before users complain (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
  Automation everywhere – fewer manual steps = fewer mistakes
  Reliability & feedback loops – SLIs, SLOs, error budgets
- devops mindset :- Small, frequent deployments , Fail fast, recover faster,Measure everything,Security is baked in (DevSecOps)
-
- Cloud Engineering:- 
Cloud Engineering is about designing, building, and maintaining systems on cloud platforms.
Core idea about cloud engineering is that Use cloud-native services to build scalable, resilient, cost-efficient systems.
- the Cloud Engineers focus on Cloud platforms – AWS, Azure, GCP , Architecture design like a Highly available systems , Auto-scaling , Fault tolerance.
- In cloud engineering its provied some cloud services like
- Compute (EC2, Lambda, AKS) , Storage (S3, Blob Storage) ,
-  Networking (VPCs, load balancers) ,
-  Managed services (RDS, DynamoDB, Pub/Sub).
- Cost optimization – right-sizing, reserved instances, FinOps
- Security & IAM – least privilege, network isolation

  
- Difference between Devops vs Cloud 
- in devops the culture & practices , how software is deliverd , CI/CD , automation and Tooling and workflows 
- in Cloud engineering :- Platform & architecture , Where software runs , Cloud services, networking , Infrastructure design

- 
- Jobs pofile :- “Cloud DevOps Engineer” , “Platform Engineer” , “SRE”
